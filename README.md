# HNSW.Net

.Net library for fast approximate nearest neighbours search.

Exact _k_ nearest neighbours search algorithms tend to perform poorly in high-dimensional spaces. To overcome curse of dimensionality the ANN algorithms come in place. This library implements one of such algorithms described in the ["Efficient and robust approximate nearest neighbor search using Hierarchical Navigable Small World graphs"](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1603/1603.09320.pdf) article. It provides simple API for building nearest neighbours graphs, (de)serializing them and running k-NN search queries.

## Usage

Check out the following code snippets once you've added the library reference to your project.

### How to build a graph?

```c#
var parameters = new SmallWorld<float[], float>.Parameters()
{
  M = 15,
  LevelLambda = 1 / Math.Log(15),
};

float[] vectors = GetFloatVectors();
var graph = new SmallWorld<float[], float>(CosineDistance.NonOptimized);
graph.BuildGraph(vectors, new Random(42), parameters);
```

### How to run k-NN search?

```c#
SmallWorld<float[], float> graph = GetGraph();

float[] query = Enumerable.Repeat(1f, 100).ToArray();
var best20 = graph.KNNSearch(query, 20);
var best1 = best20.OrderBy(r => r.Distance).First();
```

### How to (de)serialize the graph?

```c#
SmallWorld<float[], float> graph = GetGraph();
byte[] buffer = graph.SerializeGraph(); // buffer stores information about parameters and graph edges

// distance function must be the same as the one which was used for building the original graph
var copy = new SmallWorld<float[], float>(CosineDistance.NonOptimized);
copy.DeserializeGraph(vectors, buffer); // the original vectors to attach to the "copy" vertices
```

### Distance functions

The only one distance function supplied by the library is the cosine distance. But there are 4 versions to address universality/performance tradeoff.

```c#
CosineDistance.NonOptimized // most generic version works for all cases
CosineDistance.ForUnits     // gives correct result only when arguments are "unit" vectors
CosineDistance.SIMD         // uses SIMD instructions to optimize calculations
CosineDistance.SIMDForUnits // uses SIMD and requires arguments to be "units"
```

But the API allows to inject any custom distance function tailored specifically for your needs.
